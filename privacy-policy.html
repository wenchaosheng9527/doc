        <h1>xBooster Privacy Policy</h1>
        <span class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 22, 2025</span>

        <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how xBooster (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "this App") collects, uses, and discloses your personal data to provide high-quality volume enhancement and audio-related services. Please carefully read and understand the terms of this Policy before accessing, logging in to, or using the xBooster App and its related services.</p>

        <h2>I. Purposes for Using Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We attach great importance to user experience, and the information collected will be used to optimize xBooster's core functions (such as volume enhancement algorithms, sound effect modes, and interface interaction). In general, we may use personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Assisting law enforcement: Responding to legal requirements or legitimate requests from public authorities to cooperate with law enforcement-related work.</li>
            <li>Maintaining services: Ensuring the normal operation of xBooster, including fixing functional faults and optimizing service stability.</li>
            <li>Responding to your feedback: We will only contact you via email to answer questions or provide feedback on handling results when you raise issues to us through email or other electronic communication methods.</li>
            <li>Fulfilling contractual obligations: Processing purchases, orders, payments, and other transaction matters related to xBooster to ensure the smooth delivery of services.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>II. Information We Collect from You</h2>
        <p>We only collect information necessary for implementing service functions, and prioritize the collection of non-personally identifiable data, specifically including the following categories:</p>

        <h3>1. Usage Data</h3>
        <p>When you use xBooster, the system will automatically collect non-personally identifiable usage data, which is not directly associated with your identity. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>
            <li>Browser type and version (if accessing related services through the web version);</li>
            <li>xBooster function pages you visit (such as the volume adjustment page and sound effect settings page);</li>
            <li>Access time and date, and duration of stay on each function page;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you use xBooster through a mobile device, the following may also be collected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobile device type (such as smartphone, tablet);</li>
            <li>Mobile device IP address;</li>
            <li>Mobile operating system version (such as Android 14);</li>
            <li>Mobile Internet browser type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Technical Data</h3>
        <p>To further optimize the user experience, xBooster integrates data statistics tools, which are only used to locate application crash (CRASH) issues and conduct A/B testing on new functions (such as volume enhancement algorithms and sound effect modes) and interface designs. <strong>No user privacy data is collected</strong>. The collected technical data includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information: Screen size, device manufacturer name (such as Huawei, Apple), device model (such as Mate 60 Pro, iPhone 15);</li>
            <li>Device system information: Operating system name, operating system version, system build version, system language, country/region of the carrier;</li>
            <li>App information: xBooster App name, App build version, App version number (such as v2.1.0), name and version of the integrated SDK.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. App Permissions</h3>
        <p>Some functions of xBooster rely on device permissions authorized by you. All permissions are only used to implement corresponding functions and will not be used for other purposes. The details are as follows:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Permission Type</th>
                <th>Purpose of Authorization</th>
                <th>Data Usage Restrictions</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>NOTIFICATION PERMISSION</td>
                <td>If you want xBooster to display information about the currently playing audio (such as song title, singer, album cover) or switch to the next track within xBooster, this permission is required.</td>
                <td>Only used to display audio information and control track switching. No other notification content or information from the device will be obtained.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>MICROPHONE PERMISSION</td>
                <td>If you want xBooster to enable the audio spectrum display function (such as synchronously displaying the audio spectrum on the volume adjustment interface), this permission is required.</td>
                <td>Only used to generate and display the audio spectrum. No audio content will be recorded or stored, and no other device information will be obtained.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>STORAGE PERMISSION</td>
                <td>If you need to add images selected from the device's album (such as screenshots of functional abnormalities) when submitting feedback to xBooster, this permission is required.</td>
                <td>Only used to select images needed for feedback. No photos, videos, or other media content stored locally on the device will be proactively obtained, modified, or deleted.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>III. How We Disclose Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We strictly control the scope of personal data disclosure and may share or transfer your data only in the following legal scenarios:</p>

        <h3>1. Business Transactions</h3>
        <p>Your personal data may be transferred as part of the transaction assets only when the company to which xBooster belongs undergoes business transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales. Before the transaction occurs, we will notify you in advance through in-app notifications or the email you provided, ensuring that you understand the recipient and purpose of the data transfer.</p>

        <h3>2. Law Enforcement Requirements</h3>
        <p>If explicitly required by laws and regulations, or if public authorities (such as courts, government departments) make legal and valid requests, xBooster may be required to disclose your personal data to comply with legal provisions or cooperate with law enforcement work.</p>

        <h3>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
        <p>To ensure the normal operation of xBooster (such as data statistics and analysis, and application crash monitoring), we may cooperate with third-party service providers (such as Google Analytics, crash analysis tool service providers). We only share necessary non-personally identifiable data (such as device model, App usage duration) with such service providers and will require them to sign a privacy protection agreement to ensure that the data is only used for the agreed purposes and kept strictly confidential. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of such service providers to understand their data processing rules.</p>

        <h3>4. Other Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your personal data when we reasonably believe that the following actions are necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations or responding to judicial procedures;</li>
            <li>Protecting the legitimate rights and interests, brand reputation, and property security of xBooster;</li>
            <li>Investigating potential improper behaviors related to xBooster services (such as fraud, service abuse, infringement of others' rights and interests, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IV. How We Process Your Personal Data</h2>

        <h3>1. Data Access Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Internal employees of xBooster and third-party service providers may only access your relevant data within the scope of performing their job responsibilities (such as technical maintenance, customer service feedback processing). They must also comply with strict confidentiality obligations and shall not use the data for unauthorized purposes.</p>

        <h3>2. Analytics Tools</h3>
        <p>xBooster may use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to monitor and analyze App usage (such as function click-through rates, crash frequencies) to optimize volume enhancement effects and interface experience.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics is an analytics service provided by Google. The data collected by it may be used for other services under Google and support personalized advertising for Google's advertising network based on your access records of xBooster and other websites/App.</p>
        <p>You can opt out of some Google Analytics functions in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjust the advertising settings of your mobile device (such as disabling "Personalized Ads");</li>
            <li>Refer to the guidelines in Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Advertising Services</h3>
        <p>To support the development and maintenance of xBooster's free services, we may display advertisements through the following third-party service providers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: As a third-party advertising service provider, Google may display advertisements in xBooster through Cookies. Google uses DoubleClick Cookie technology to enable itself and its partners to deliver advertisements more relevant to your needs based on your access records of xBooster and other Internet websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can opt out of the Google AdMob service by following Google's guidelines: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762</a>.</p>
